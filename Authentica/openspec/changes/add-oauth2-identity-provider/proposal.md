## Why
Create a comprehensive OAuth2 identity provider called Authentica that provides complete user authentication, authorization, and identity management capabilities with modern security features including MFA, passkeys, and administrative controls.

## What Changes
- Add complete OAuth2 authorization server capabilities with standard flows
- Implement comprehensive user management with registration, login, and profile management
- Add multi-factor authentication support with email and authenticator app methods
- Integrate passkey authentication for passwordless authentication
- Create user details management for profile updates
- Add application management for client applications and secrets
- Implement session management for active user sessions
- Provide comprehensive admin management controls and role-based access

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (new capabilities)
- Affected code: Complete identity provider implementation required
- Breaking changes: None (new system)

## Scope Overview
This proposal creates 8 distinct capability areas:
1. **OAuth2** - Core authorization server functionality
2. **User Management** - User registration, authentication, and basic operations
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - MFA flows and management
4. **Passkey Authentication** - WebAuthn-based passwordless authentication
5. **User Details** - Profile and contact information management
6. **Application Management** - OAuth2 client application management
7. **Session Management** - Active session tracking and control
8. **Admin Management** - Administrative operations and role management
