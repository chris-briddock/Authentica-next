#### Scenario: Session metadata
- **WHEN** retrieving sessions
- **THEN** the system SHALL include session metadata such as:
  - Device type and user agent
  - IP address and geolocation
  - Authentication method used
  - Creation and last access times
  - Application/client information

#### Scenario: No active sessions
- **WHEN** a user has no active sessions
- **THEN** the system SHALL return an empty list
- **AND** indicate no active sessions found

### Requirement: Session Deletion
The system SHALL provide a DELETE /sessions endpoint for terminating specific sessions.

#### Scenario: Delete specific session
- **WHEN** a user requests deletion of a specific session by ID
- **THEN** the system SHALL immediately invalidate the specified session
- **AND** not affect other active sessions
- **AND** return confirmation of session termination

#### Scenario: Delete current session
- **WHEN** a user deletes their current session
- **THEN** the system SHALL invalidate the session
- **AND** require the user to re-authenticate to continue

#### Scenario: Delete non-existent session
- **WHEN** attempting to delete a session that doesn't exist

### Requirement: Session Security and Validation
The system SHALL manage sessions with appropriate security measures.

#### Scenario: Session timeout
- **WHEN** a session exceeds the maximum allowed duration
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically invalidate the session

#### Scenario: Concurrent session limits
- **WHEN** a user exceeds the maximum allowed concurrent sessions
- **THEN** the system SHALL enforce session limits
- **AND** either reject new sessions or terminate oldest sessions

### Requirement: Session Monitoring and Auditing
The system SHALL monitor session activity for security purposes.

#### Scenario: Suspicious activity detection
- **WHEN** detecting unusual session patterns (multiple locations, rapid logins)
- **THEN** the system SHALL flag the activity for review
- **AND** potentially require additional authentication

#### Scenario: Session activity logging
- **WHEN** session events occur (creation, access, termination)
- **THEN** the system SHALL log all session activities
- **AND** maintain audit trails for compliance and security

#### Scenario: Cross-device tracking
- **WHEN** tracking sessions across different devices
- **THEN** the system SHALL correlate sessions by user and device
- **AND** provide clear device identification for session management

### Requirement: Session Management for Administrators
The system SHALL provide enhanced session management for privileged accounts.

#### Scenario: Admin session requirements
- **WHEN** administrators establish sessions
- **THEN** the system SHALL enforce shorter session durations
- **AND** require periodic re-authentication for privileged operations

#### Scenario: Emergency session termination
- **WHEN** administrators need to terminate user sessions
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide bulk session termination capabilities
- **AND** require appropriate authorization for such actions
